## What is Delphereum?

Delphereum is a Delphi interface to the Ethereum blockchain that allows for development of native dapps (aka _decentralized_ applications).

## What is Delphi?

[Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) is a development environment that compiles into native apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## What is Ethereum?

[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring Smart Contracts.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A Smart Contract is a computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. You can think of a Smart Contract as a microservice that runs trustless on the backend of your application.

Smart Contracts can have many applications, ranging from sports betting to online voting. But the true power of Smart Contracts is in managing assets that have value and are scarce.

Once added to the blockchain, a Smart Contract becomes public and cannot be modified or removed. This assures your users that the rules are transparent and will never change.

## What is a dapp?

A [dapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) is an application whose backend runs on a decentralised network with trustless protocols. Dapps arenâ€™t owned by anyone, cannot be shut down, and have zero downtime.

## Dependencies

Before you can compile this project, you will need to clone the following repositories, and then add them to your Delphi Library path:
```
git clone https://github.com/rvelthuis/DelphiBigNumbers
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/SimpleBaseLib4Pascal
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/HashLib4Pascal
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/CryptoLib4Pascal
```
Please note there are NO runtime dependencies. Delphereum is lightweight and self-contained.
